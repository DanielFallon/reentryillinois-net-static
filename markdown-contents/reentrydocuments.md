## [$880,000 a Day to Incarcerate Persons with Mental Illness in Illinois?]

In an article in Homeless Headlines in February 2011, John Fallon and Corinne Rearer show that there are at least 7,143 a day persons with mental illness who are in a prison, jail, or a forensic hospital in Illinois on any given day. A tremendous number of these arrests could be prevented by better assertive treatment in the community and affordable housing. This costs the State of Illinois over $880,000 a day. Supportive housing for that entire group could potentially save over $487,000 a day. Treatment and housing for some of this group could be a way to save money, increase public safety, and do the right thing. Here is a link to the article as it was published.

## [Ill Equipped by Human Rights Watch]

This 215-page report examines how prisons are dangerous and damaging places for mentally ill people.  Mentally ill prisoners are more likely than others to end up housed in especially harsh conditions, such as isolation, that can push them over the edge into acute psychosis.  Across the country, prisoners cannot get appropriate care because of a shortage of qualified staff, lack of facilities, and prison rules that interfere with treatment. The report is based on more than two years of research and hundreds of interviews with prisoners, corrections officials, mental health experts and attorneys and makes recommendations on services and regulations that would assist and protect mentally ill prisoners.
