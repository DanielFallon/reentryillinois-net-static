# Lack of Housing

Every community will need to prepare for the return of their residents following incarceration by providing resources necessary for reintegration.  These resources include but are not limited to public housing.  There is a tremendous need to create safe, affordable housing with the necessary support services as well as policies that do not include restrictions for persons with past convictions. The restrictions that lead to expulsion or exclusion have resulted in higher rates of homelessness for the most vulnerable persons. To read more about this issue, click [here][Housing Project]
