# Lack of Identification

If we can advocate for the Illinois Secretary of State co-locating in a prison or jail as is done in our neighboring state of Indiana , state identification can be issued upon release.  Proper identification will make the reentry process smoother for not only for the person coming home, but also for the community to which he or she is returning.  This can work if accurately identifying and documenting our Illinois prison and jail population is prioritized, regardless of whether or not an alias was used upon arrest.
