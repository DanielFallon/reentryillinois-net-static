# Best Re-Entry Preparation Guides Across the Country

The [San Francisco Re-Entry Council] and the Safe Communities Reentry Council have collaborated to form the Access to Resources Working Group.  The product of this collaboration is the resource guide entitled, [Getting Out, Staying Out: A Guide to San Francisco Resources for People leaving Jails and Prisons].
