Depending on where you attended school, you may be able to use your school records to help establish your identity.  If you attended school in the Chicago Public School system, you may access your student records by visiting the [Chicago Public School Student Records website].  You can fill out the application form to retrieve your records if they are available for no charge.

If you attended school anywhere else, you can contact the school directly and ask about their policy.  Sometimes they are stored at the school, other times they are stored at a district office.  You will most likely be asked about when you attended the school and the names of your parents/guardians.
