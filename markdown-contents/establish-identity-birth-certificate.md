In order to get a certified copy of your birth certificate, you need to contact the county clerk in the county where you were born.  If you were born outside of Cook County, you will need help in getting the address of your birth county.  You can find this information online.

If you were born in Cook County , you can get your birth certificate from the Cook County Clerk’s Office in several ways.  You will need official identification (Driver’s License, State ID, Military ID, etc.), but you may also be able to prove your identity with 2 of the following:

- Social Security Card
- Voter registration card (issued within past 90 days)
- W-2 form (most recent tax year)
- Bank statement (issued within past 90 days)
- Utility bill (issued within past 60 days)
- Vehicle registration card
