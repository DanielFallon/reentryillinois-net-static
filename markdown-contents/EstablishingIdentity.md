# Establishing Your Identity

## Important Forms of Id

In today’s world, you have to have identification (ID) to do things like cash a check, take a driver’s test, or get a job. The first step in a successful transition back into your community will be having ID so that you can get what you need.  Forms of ID that many places accept are:

- [Birth Certificate]
- [Social Security Card]
- [Marriage Certificate]
- [Court Order]
- [School Records]

This website will help you get some or all of these documents. You might even be able to get some of these documents for free.

**Planning Tip:** If you have moved around a lot and have had trouble staying housed, please consider asking a reliable friend or family member to hold onto your important documents (Social Security Card, Birth Certificate, School Records, Medical Records.)  This way, you will have one safe place if you ever need to get another State ID or Driver’s License.
