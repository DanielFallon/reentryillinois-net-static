# Getting Support Services

Here are the facts: There are 66,000 people in prison and jail right now in Illinois . There are only 2 people  in most prisons whose job is to work on discharge planning (Field Services). You will not be viewed as a profitable client as you will have trouble with identification, funding, and community support. You have been accused of a crime, living away from home, and many law abiding citizens can not get services.

If you want services, you will have to work hard to make yourself attractive to a service provider.  You will need to see the world through other people's points of view even if this is unfair:

1. Read or look at some of the [re-entry preparation manuals] and see if if one of them helps you.
1. Make sure that your out-date is calculated correctly six months from your discharge.  This includes your good time, time served, and any education or program time for which you get credit. Your field service counselor begins your planning six months beforehand based on this date.
1. Use any classes to prepare you for discharge and talk to any teachers about resources and assistance in getting into programming.
1. Counselors base their success on getting you into programming and keeping you out of trouble once you leave the institution.  Be honest with them about your past including your medical history and past services used.  They are looking to see if you are eligible for specific programming.
1. Make contact with any outside programming that is based in your community. Most programs have trouble going to the prisons and so you may start in less desirable programs.  Begin there, do well, and you will later be eligible for better programs.
