# Lack of Health Care

For disabled individuals that qualify, Medicaid services can be made available upon release so that medication is available to control symptoms of medical and psychiatric conditions.  Providing the means to access health care through a community clinic is far less costly than expensive emergency rooms.  It may also provide for restoration of federal benefits (SSI, SSDI) in a timelier manner, which in turn expedites federal reimbursement to the state.  In addition, it is sound policy that persons who enter institutions with Medicaid benefits should have those benefits suspended and not terminated. Doing this will ensure that those who suffer from disabling conditions can access health care and psychiatric services upon discharge in a less costly and more efficient manner.
