# Re-Entry Issues for those with C-Numbers

All persons currently sentenced in Illinois are given a fixed sentence.  This sentence includes the possibility of a "mandatory supervised release" commonly referred to as parole.

Prior to 1978, people were given an indeterminate sentence and were released only after a parole hearing with the parole board.  There are currently about 300 persons in Illinois prisons sentenced under the old system awaiting release. Much has been written about this group by advocates working for their release.

Most recently, the John Howard Association has written about this issue in a paper entitled, [To Set the Record Straight][To Set the Record Straight].   

There are also numerous advocacy groups helping this group and advocating how to assist in the process of release. One is the [Campaign in Support of C Number Prisoners][Campaign in Support of C Number Prisoners]. 

For more information about this group you can also go the [Illinois Department of Corrections Web Site][IDOC].
